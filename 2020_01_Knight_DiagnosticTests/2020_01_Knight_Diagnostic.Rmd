# What is a "Diagnostic Test"?

---

## A diagnostic test is a medical test that determines a *target condition*:

- nature or severity of disease (i.e. disease stage)
- risk of future disease condition or event
- response to treatment (actually *"prognostic" test*)


.pull-left-60[
## The medical test may be a

- biomarker
- imaging procedure
- laboratory test
- health history or physical examination
- a combination of the above
- any other method collecting current health information
]
.pull-right-40[

]
---

# Goals of a diagnostic study may be to determine

- Accuracy of the test to assess disease
- Accuracy of test to predict disease in the future (i.e. within 3 years)
- Reliability or reproducibility of test
- Technical variability of test

We will focus on the first two goals: *accuracy of the test to determine a binary (yes/no) condition in the present or in the future*

---

# Evaluate accuracy, compared to ...?

We need to compare our "index test" of interest to a "reference standard" a.k.a. the "gold standard."

How do we diagnose the disease? The reference standard is the best available method(s).

Example:

- blood sample biomarker (index text) compared to biopsy or imaging (reference standard)
- pregnancy urine test (index test) compared to highly accurate blood test (or ultrasound)

# Evaluate accuracy: Statistics 
.pull-left-40[

Continuous (numerical) test $\rightarrow$ must select test positivity cut-off

Or, How to classify disease based on a range of possible test results?

# Evaluate accuracy: Statistics 

For all possible cut-off values (entire operating characteristic)
- ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve)

For a specific cutoff:
- Sensitivity and specificity
- PPV (Positive Predictive Value) and NPV (Negative Predictive Value)

.pull-left-60[
## Sensitivity and Specificity

- How does the test perform in people with or without the disease?
- Sensitivity = True Positive Rate (TPR) 
    + Probability someone with the disease tests positive
    + Are we finding the cases?
    + Also called "recall"
- Specificity = True Negative Rate (TNR) in people without the disease
    + Probability someone without the disease tests negative
    + Are we not scaring the healthy people?
- Should be reported together
- Online calculator: [www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php](https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php)

## Positive & Negative Predictive Values: PPV, NPV

- How does the test perform in people with positive or negative test values?
- PPV = Probability someone has the disease if they test positive
  + If positive test how likely do I have the disease? (Should I be worried?)
- NPV = Probability someone does not have the disease if they test negative
  + If negative test how likely am I healthy? (Am I reassured?)
- Depends on *prevalence* of disease (if very rare, PPV might be very low)

# ROC Curve

.pull-left[

- Combination of sensitivity & specificity for each possible test positivity cut-off
    + Sensitivity $\approx$ "power"
    + FPR (1-specificity) $\approx$ "significance level" of a test
    + $\to$ ROC plots power vs significance level of a test.
- Useful for comparing multiple tests, but often we only care about the edges (high sensitivity or high specificity)

# AUC (Area Under the Curve)

.pull-left[
- Area under the ROC Curve
- Single numerical value represents overall accuracy
- *Not* for a specific sensitivity/specificity or cut-off value
- Probability a "case" has a higher test value than a "control" (Can we even sort them?)
- 0.5 is the AUC of a coin flip

# Accuracy vs. Reproducibility

Does the test accurately diagnose the disease?

vs.

Is the test reproducible over time or over testing system?

- variation in reading imaging
- technical variability in the assay
- limits of detection
- highly variable throughout the day (influenced by fasting, or environment)

# Designing Studies

---

## Phases in the assessment of diagnostic accuracy

- Phase I (Discovery)
    + Establish technical parameters, algorithms, diagnostic critera
- Phase II (Introductory)
    + Early quantification of performance in clinical settings
- Phase III (Mature)
    + Comparison to other testing modalities in prospective, typically multi-institutional studies (*efficacy*)
- Phase IV (Disseminated)
    + Assessment of the procedure as utilized in the community at large (*effectiveness*)

For Use in Patient Centered Outcomes Research" (2012)](https://www.pcori.org/assets/Standards-in-the-Design-Conduct-and-Evaluation-of-Diagnostic-Testing-for-Use-in-Patient-Centered-Outcomes-Research.pdf)

## Diagnostic studies

- Observational trials to determine accuracy
  + less costly
  + may have unidentified biases, may lack all information to inform test
- Randomized trials to assess accuracy and/or efficacy
  + minimizes selection bias/confounding, prospective design minimizes temporal ambiguity
  + expensive, homogeneous population
- Randomized trials to incorporate an intervention
  + Who receives the intervention?

- Paired (B) design more efficient

# Sample Size and Power

What is the outcome/effect size measure?

- Compare AUC to gold standard - new test and reference standard on same population
    + Need to know AUC of gold standard, proposed test's AUC, prevalence, correlation of two tests within case and control patients
- Compare sensitivity and specificity of a binary test = binomial proportion calculator
